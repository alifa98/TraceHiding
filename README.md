# TraceHiding: A Machine Unlearning Framework for Trajectory Classification

This repository contains the official implementation of the **TraceHiding** framework, developed as part of the thesis:

> (Submitted to *ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems*)

## üß† Overview

As machine learning models increasingly rely on personal and location-based data, **user privacy** has become a critical concern. This work introduces a novel framework for **machine unlearning** in the context of **trajectory classification**‚Äîan area where removing learned representations poses significant challenges due to the spatiotemporal nature of the data.

**TraceHiding** offers an efficient and effective solution for selectively forgetting user trajectories from trained models without costly retraining.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* üìç **Trajectory Unlearning**: Designed specifically for trajectory-based data.
* ‚öñÔ∏è **Privacy‚ÄìUtility Balance**: Optimizes privacy while preserving predictive performance.
* üìä **Influence Ranking**: Uses a hierarchical scoring system to rank tokens, trajectories, and users by their influence on the model.
* üß™ **Distillation Loss**: Applies a teacher‚Äìstudent distillation technique to retain useful patterns while forgetting specific data points.
* üìà **Reproducible Benchmarks**: Includes datasets, train/test splits, and evaluation tools to support reproducibility and comparison.
